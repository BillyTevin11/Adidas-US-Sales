# ðŸ“Š Adidas US Sales Analysis

# Overview
This project dives into the sales performance of Adidas products across the United States, transforming raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using Power BI. It demonstrates how data analytics can power strategic decisions in retailâ€”from optimizing inventory to maximizing profit margins.

# Objective
The aim is to uncover actionable insights from Adidas' sales data by analyzing revenue trends, profitability metrics, sales channels, regional performance, and product-specific behavior. Through interactive dashboards and data visualizations, the project seeks to answer critical business questions, such as:

1. Which product categories generate the most revenue and profit?

2.Which sales method (In-store, Outlet, or Online) is most effective?

3. How do operating margins vary across product lines?

4. What temporal or regional patterns influence sales performance?

# Tools & Techniques
- Power BI for data modeling, dashboarding, and storytelling

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom measures and calculated insights

- ETL steps (within Power Query) to clean and prepare raw sales data

- Exploratory data analysis driven by retail KPIs: total sales, units sold, operating profit, and margin analysis

# Key Findings
ðŸ”¹ Menâ€™s Street Footwear emerged as the most profitable and high-revenue category

ðŸ”¹ In-store sales dominated revenue contribution, outperforming Online and Outlet channels

ðŸ”¹ The average operating margin across products hovered around 42.3%, signaling room for optimization

ðŸ”¹ Some products sold in high volumes yet underperformed in profit, hinting at pricing or cost inefficiencies

ðŸ”¹ Seasonal and regional trends provided insight into strategic stocking and marketing opportunities

# Why It Matters
In a competitive retail environment, data is more than just numbersâ€”itâ€™s an edge. This analysis offers a realistic yet insightful blueprint for using Power BI to convert raw retail data into business intelligence. From marketing strategists to supply chain managers, the findings in this project can influence how Adidas or any retail brand aligns its resources.
